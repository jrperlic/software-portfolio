# Overview

As a computer science student looking to get an internship, I thought it would be prudent to make a software portfolio, a place where I can store my projects.

The first program I have in the porftolio is called `motion.py`. It is a simple program that detects movement using Python's OpenCV library. The second, called `detection.py`, builds off the first. It uses OpenCV, as well as Haar Cascades, to identify faces and eyes.

`temperature.clj` is my final project from my Clojure class. It converts the temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.

# Development Environment

The programming languages that I'm most familiar with are Python and C++. I do all my work in Visual Studio Code.

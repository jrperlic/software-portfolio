# Overview

As a computer science student looking to get an internship, I thought it would be prudent to make a software portfolio, a place where I can store my projects.

The first program and only I have in the porftolio is called `motion.py`. It is a simple program that detects movement using Python's OpenCV library.

# Development Environment

The programming languages that I'm most familiar with are Python and C++. I do all my work in Visual Studio Code.

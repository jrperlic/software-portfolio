# Overview

As a computer science student looking to get an internship, I thought it would be prudent to make a software portfolio, a place where I can store my projects.

Right now, I haven't got any software to put in the portfolio, but I will soon. The Hello World program is there as a placeholder, and to test if the portfolio is working properly.

# Development Environment

The programming languages that I'm most familiar with are Python, C++, and HTML. I do all my work in Visual Studio Code.
